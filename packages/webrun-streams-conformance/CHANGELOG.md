# @statewalker/webrun-streams-conformance

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- a4d705c: **Breaking: L6 is redefined around run-ahead, and `PairTuning` is reshaped (spec D17).** `PairTuning` is now `{ maxMessageSize?: number }`; `mtu` and `maxStreamBuffer` described `emulateMux`'s window, which is gone. `ConnectServePair` gains an optional `runAheadBytes`: the most bytes a producer may get ahead of a consumer that stopped reading.
  
  L6 now has three tests:
  - A 256 KiB body crosses as 4 KiB messages to a slow consumer, intact.
  - In each direction, a producer facing a consumer that stops after one chunk must stall within `runAheadBytes`, then finish with every byte intact once the consumer resumes.
  
  A pair that declares no bound gets the completion check alone. Measured bounds:
  
  | Pair | Bound |
  | --- | --- |
  | Loopback | 0 |
  | Port stack | 0 (declared one 4 KiB chunk) |
  | `-webrtc` | 4 MiB, its window |
  | `-libp2p` | none: 22–24 MiB ahead until libp2p aborts the stream; recorded in its README |

### Patch Changes

- e5e180b: **Breaking: `emulateMux` is removed (Plan C3).** Every transport now runs `webrun-rpc`'s port stack. Each adapter gives a pipe (`messageTargetOver…`), `overPipe` with `msgpackCodec` invents a port per call on it, and `webrun-rpc`'s `connect` / `serve` run one call per port. On that stack a producer stays at most one chunk ahead of its consumer; `emulateMux` buffered up to its 8 MiB window. The wire format changes, so both ends must upgrade together.
  
  - `webrun-streams`: `emulateMux`, `EmulateMuxOptions` and `ByteChannel` are gone. `newCreditLedger` / `newCreditGrantor` stay exported, dormant, as the mechanism for per-stream windowing (spec D13).
  - `webrun-streams-ws`, `-peerjs`, `-livekit`: the `emulateMux`-based `connect` / `serve` and `byteChannelFromWebSocket` / `byteChannelFromPeerJs` / `byteChannelFromLiveKit` are gone. Use `messageTargetOverWebSocket` / `messageTargetOverPeerJs` / `messageTargetOverLiveKit` with `overPipe` (see each README). None of the three has a runtime dependency left.
  - `webrun-rpc`: `byteChannelFromMessagePort` is gone; a `MessagePort` goes to `overPipe` directly.
  - `webrun-streams-signaling`: `ByteChannel` is now declared here, with the same shape, and the package has no runtime dependency. Import the type from this package instead of `webrun-streams`. New `messageTargetOverByteChannel(channel)` runs the port stack over a channel this package hands back, reporting 16 KiB − 256 as `maxMessageSize`.
  - `webrun-streams-conformance`: comments only. `PairTuning` is unchanged here, and every pair now ignores it until D17 redefines L6.
  - `webrun-http-streams`: comments only. Its peer-error slot test now runs on the port stack.
  
  `webrun-streams-signaling` also fixes `byteChannelFromRoom`, which never ended. It now closes when the room disconnects, when its participant leaves, or when a reliable publish fails, and it ignores packets that carry no participant. Before this, anything run over it (now the port stack) hung when the other end went away.

### Minor Changes

- ff650fc: Replace stop-and-wait flow control with credit-based flow control in `emulateMux`.

  **Wire format changed and is incompatible with peers predating this release.**
  OPEN and ACK frames now carry a uint32 credit payload. A peer running the old
  protocol cannot interoperate with one running this version; both sides of a
  connection must be upgraded together. `emulateMux` now costs one additional
  round trip per stream at open time, to establish the initial credit window.

  Every package that embeds `emulateMux` is bumped explicitly here — rather than
  left to the automatic "dependent" bump — because a dependent-only changelog
  entry does not mention a protocol break, and consumers need to see one:
  `@statewalker/webrun-rpc` (renamed from `@statewalker/webrun-streams-port`),
  `@statewalker/webrun-streams-ws`,
  `@statewalker/webrun-streams-peerjs`, and `@statewalker/webrun-streams-livekit`
  all embed the new wire format and gain a `mux` parameter on their connection
  params (`PortParams`, `ConnectWsParams`/`ServeWsParams`, and the peerjs/livekit
  equivalents). `@statewalker/webrun-streams-webrtc` and
  `@statewalker/webrun-streams-libp2p` multiplex natively and are unaffected;
  they still pick up the automatic dependent bump from
  `updateInternalDependencies: "minor"`.

  `@statewalker/webrun-streams` itself adds new exports (`newCreditLedger`,
  `CreditLedger`, `newCreditGrantor`, `CreditGrantor`) and two smaller behavior
  changes on the same minor: `emulateMux` now throws `RangeError` for
  `maxStreamBuffer < 1`, where it previously accepted it silently, and a
  window above `2^32 - 1` is now advertised as `2^32 - 1` instead of wrapping.

  `@statewalker/webrun-streams-conformance`'s `MakePair` gains a parameter, and
  adds a new L6 conformance level.

  `@statewalker/webrun-http-browser` is bumped explicitly rather than left to
  the dependent bump: `src/core/index.ts` re-exports
  `@statewalker/webrun-streams` in full (`export * from "@statewalker/webrun-streams"`),
  so the four new credit-ledger exports above, plus Task 6's four
  `MessageTarget` types, become public exports of this package too.

  The RPC tier (`webrun-rpc`'s send/receive) is unchanged here; its move from
  `webrun-streams-port` and its retyping to accept any `MessageTarget` are
  credited separately, in the `port-layer-to-webrun-rpc` changeset.
