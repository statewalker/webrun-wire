- 2291ab3: Cancellation now reaches the producer, across every adapter.

  Nine defects, found by putting one unchanged HTTP site in front of a real
  Chromium and measuring what happened when a caller walked away. They formed a
  chain — each one hid the next, so none could be fixed alone.

  **Teardown that never reached the producer.** `duplexOverStream` awaited a
  `.return()` that is queued behind a pending `next()`, so it hung for ever;
  `emulateMux`'s outbound pump checked `closed` only _after_ a chunk arrived, so
  the producer leaked. Both acquire the iterator once and cancel without awaiting
  now. `framedOutbound` also stopped telling a _server's_ handler that its caller
  had gone — a regression introduced while fixing the first two, and caught by a
  test rather than by review.

  **Cancellation that stopped at the adapter.** `toReadableStream` had no `cancel`
  at all, so a cancelled response body never released the iterator feeding it; it
  also drained its whole source inside a single `pull`, which defeated the
  stream's own backpressure and left no point between chunks at which a
  cancellation could take effect. `fromReadableStream` never released its reader,
  so an early exit — `break`, `.return()`, an error — left the source stream
  uncancelled and its producer running. Between them they broke every abort path
  in the repo.

  **A transport with no cancellation message.** Closing a `MessagePort` does not
  notify its peer, so the ServiceWorker HTTP transport's teardown was invisible on
  the far side and a browser handler kept producing for the life of the page after
  its caller had gone. It sends one now, and the receiving channel releases what
  it is sending — without awaiting, because `.return()` on a parked generator is
  queued behind its own pending `next()`.

  **A worker url that could not be relative.** `new URL("/sw-worker.js")` with no
  base throws `Invalid URL` from a _constructor_, naming neither the option nor
  the value. A worker url is relative to the document that registers it, so it is
  resolved against `location.href` now.

  **A port stack that only accepted `MessagePort`.** `PortParams.port` and
  `byteChannelFromMessagePort` were narrowed to `MessagePort` though neither uses
  more than the `MessageTarget` surface they are otherwise written against. The
  narrowing shut out every virtual port — including one backed by a libp2p stream,
  which is how a mesh hands out ports at all. Found by `tsc`.

  A ServiceWorker _is_ told when its client aborts: `request.signal` never fires
  in Chromium, but the `ReadableStream` given to `respondWith` has its `cancel()`
  invoked. That measurement is what established these as transport defects rather
  than a platform limit, and it was taken with none of the code under suspicion.

  Regression tests live beside each fix: `readable-streams-cancel.test.ts`,
  `emulate-mux-cancel-input.test.ts`, `cancel-open-input.test.ts`,
  `cancel-server-handler.test.ts`, `http-cancel.test.ts` (which reproduces the
  browser leak with two plain `MessagePort`s and no ServiceWorker), and
  `sw-worker-url.test.ts`.

  Backpressure on the deprecated ServiceWorker transport is untouched and its
  deprecation note remains true: `sendStream`'s chunk sender still discards the
  promise it is given.
